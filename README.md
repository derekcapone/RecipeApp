This repository contains all code related to a Google Chrome web extension that allows users to input ingredients that they wish to make a meal out of. This will allow users to think of meal ideas based on what they already have at home to use up their existing ingredients instead of going to the grocery store (because who wants to actually leave their house).

This software is not used to make any money and is mostly just being used for personal practice of various programming skills, mainly being database manipulation, API usage, web-extension development, various Python skills, etc.
